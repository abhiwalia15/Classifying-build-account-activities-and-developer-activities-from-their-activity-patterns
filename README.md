data on the changes in static metrics between code revisions made in version control systems. This captures a range of activities, and commits can contain either human coding effort or automated processes, e.g. importing or generating existing code. Commits from automation are not necessarily reflective of the effort spent by a developer making changes to code.   To make their own lives easier, commonly non-human effort can be isolated to specific non-human accounts, and spotting this sort of activity automatically can make analysis easier. We have developed automated solutions which capture the majority of build accounts in order to tackle this problem. This work sample concerns creating a machine learning approach to solving that same problem.
